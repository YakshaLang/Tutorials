# Getting started

## Setting things up
### Downloading

1. Head to [releases](https://github.com/YakshaLang/Yaksha/releases)
2. Pick an archive format you like `.7z` or `.zip` (both has same content and `.7z` is almost alwasy likely to be smaller in size)
3. Since this is a new language we recommend you always download latest version. Please expect things to not work.

### Installing

1. After download is completed you can extract the archive. Here are few ways:
  - Windows: use [7zip application](https://www.7-zip.org/)
  - GNU/Linux: use `7za` or `unzip` depending on archive format.
2. Now you can add `bin` directory to PATH.
3. If you are in GNU/Linux ensure that binaries in the `bin` directory have `+x` (executable) permission assigned. `chmod +x *`
